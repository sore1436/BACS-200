My plan for my project is to create a hub for all my favorite memes. I have a pretty diverse sense of humor and have many different interests so i plan to catalog a lot of them here. There'll be a main home and a menu that goes to each category of memes. Some of the categories I plan on using are like online learning, dungeons and dragons, and UNC. I need to focus on displaying the pictures in a nice way and making the navigation easy.

For Milestone 3, I will be using a different method of displaying photos on each page. 
UNC: Tab Gallery
DND: Image Grid
Musical: Slideshow/Carousel
Online Learning: Shaking Images
I'll also have a pressed effect animated button to go to an external site on the main page.
