    <h2>Video Script/Outline</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wealth inequality in America has grown along with its wealth concentration.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos own as much combined as the bottom 50% of Americans.</li>
            <li>The Richest American, Jeff Bezos is worth 21 more times than the one in 1982, Daniel Ludwig.</li>
            <li>The top 1% owns more than 50% of stock and less than 5% of debt.</li>
            <li>Bottom 50% owns only 1% of wealth and 1 in 10 families have a negative net worth.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Racial wealth inequality in the US is also a serious problem.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>A typical white family has almost 10 times more wealth than a typical black family</li>
            <li>And they also have over 7 times more wealth than a typical Hispanic family.</li>
            <li>Black and Hispanic families are twice as likely as white families to have zero or negative net worth.</li>
            <li>Homeownership in the US is heavily skewed towards white families.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Gender Wealth Inequality is not decreasing as most people believe.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Women only make up around 30% of the top 10% earners and only 17% of the top 1%.</li>
            <li>From 1997 to 2017, the female-to-male earnings ratio has only increased from 74% to 82%.</li>
            <li>A gender pay gap still exists in all racial groups and men make more than women in every US industry.</li>
            <li>Finally, US Men have about 3 times more retirement savings than women.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Some Proposed Solutions to Americas wealth gap are as follows:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Significantly increase the minimum wage and even guarantee employment.</li>
            <li>Raise taxes on the extremely wealthy to decrease the severe concentration of wealth.</li>
            <li>Support all forms of housing and also invest in those that are affordable.</li>
            <li>Help every day families build rainy-day funds and increase their saved wealth by encouraging early-in-life investments.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
