    <h1>What Amuses Me?</h1>
    <h2>John Mulaney</h2>

    <p>John Mulaney is an American stand up comedian and he never fails to make me cry with laughter. I'm sure basically everyone has heard of him by now but I just can't not mention him when talking about what amuses me.</p>
    <p>He has several stand-up specials on Netflix including "New in Town", "The Comeback Kid", and "Kid Gorgeous at Radio City Music Hall". Even if you don't have Netflix there are clips of his comedy bits on youtube. I would suggest you listen to the audio clip of his "Salt and Pepper Diner" bit or watch his "prostate exam" (I know it sounds weird) bit. </p>

    <h2>Cyanide and Happiness</h2>

    <p>Cyanide and Happiness is an online comic that uses crude and dark humor. It never fails to make me chuckle or laugh. They also have some animated shorts on YouTube using the same art style and humor.</p>
    <p>The game "Joking Hazard" was created by the same team and it's one of my favorites to play with my friends.It's like the comic version of "Cards Against Humanity".</p>

    <p>Road work ahead? Uh, yeah. I sure hope it does. </p>
    <p>You probably recognize him from his iconic vine but he also has a YouTube channel that is one of my current favorites. His comedy commentary videos are hilarious and so creative.</p>
