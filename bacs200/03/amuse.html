    <h1>What Amuses Me?</h1>
    <h2>John Mulaney</h2>

    <p>John Mulaney is an American stand up comedian and he never fails to make me cry with laughter. I'm sure basically everyone has heard of him by now but I just can't not mention him when talking about what amuses me.</p>
    <p>He has several stand-up specials on Netflix including  "New in Town", "The Comeback Kid", and "Kid Gorgeous at Radio City Music Hall". Een if you don't have Netflix there are clips of his comedy bits on youtube. I would suggest you listen to the audio clip of his "Salt and Pepper Diner" bit or watch his "prostate exam" (I know it sounds weird) bit. </p>
