Martin Luther King, Jr.
MLK

What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.

    Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal
    Motivate others - people follow a great leader
    Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world
    Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything
    Integrity - they live true to their calling

Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.
