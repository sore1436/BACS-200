            I believe that Jameela Jamil is one of the most important role models, especially for women, of our time. Jameela Jamil started her career in tv as a host for the pop culture show T4, but most people probably recognize her from her role as Tahani Al-Jamil for the show “The Good Place”. While she is fantastic in this show (which you should totally watch if you haven’t already), that’s not the reason why I look up to her.

            I view her as an inspiration because she uses her platform to support body positivity, women’s rights, and spread awareness of climate change. She speaks out for what she believes is right regardless if it will damage her career or reputation. She has said, “This industry doesn’t mean enough to me to be a bad role model. Nothing means enough to me to abuse my position and not speak up for those being damaged.” She calls out other celebrities for pushing unhealthy products or ideals to young women and shares her personal struggles with self-love and body dysmorphia. She uses her privilege to empower and embolden her fans, not tear them down.

            Every time I see a new post or story from her it makes me feel less alone, as I’m sure it does to hundreds if not thousands of other people. She makes me want to speak up and do what I can to make the world a better place; to leave it better than I found it. What else could a person want from a role model?
